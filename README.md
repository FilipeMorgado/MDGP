# MDGP - Maximally Diverse Grouping Problem
Project carried out for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class at ISEC. Project made in C with the objective of testing various types of AI algorithms.

In this project were used the algorithms: 
  - Hill Climbing using 1 and 2 neighbors accepting and not accepting same values.
  - Hill Climbing Probabilistic Algorithm.
  - Simulated Recrystallization Algorithm.
  - Tabu Search Algorithm.
  - Evolutionary Algorithm using: binary mutation, One-Point crossover, Two-point crossover, Uniform corssover.
  - Hybrid algorithm using a combination of several different algorithms mentioned above.
